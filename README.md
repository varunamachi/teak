A attempt to improve [Vaali](https://github.com/varunamachi/vaali).

Intended changes are:
* Use idiomatic Go practices as much as possible
* Fix error handling
* Better source code organization
* Use Go modules instead of Dep
* Change Mgo from https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo to https://github.com/globalsign/mgo
* Postgres support for common operations

Details will be added later.

## Note
This repo is expected to be broken for some time
